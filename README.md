## Background:
I'm a simple person who admires complex things. That's why I love studying human 🧠 and machine 💻 behavior, learning every nook and cranny about the hows and whys of those topics. My professional carreer was molded by that passion, since I'm a full stack developer 👨‍💻 and I also have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology 🎓.

## Tech:
- ⚡ JavaScript
- 🔙 Node.js | Express.js
- ⚛️ React | Redux
- 🐘 SQL | PostgreSQL | Sequelize
- 🏗️ HTML
- 🖌️ CSS | SASS | Less
- 🚀 PHP (still a beginner)


### Notes aside, I also deeply enjoy:
- 🤘 metal music
- ❄️ northern languages, such as finnish and swedish
- 🎮 videogames, especially those involving strategy and management (real time or turn-based).
